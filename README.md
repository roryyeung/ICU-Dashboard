# ICU-Screens
A quick project designed to prototype screens for St Mary's ICU.

# Overview Screens
These are intended to run on vertically oriented screens in the reception and nurses stations of the ICU.

They are hard-coded HTML pages, using javascript fetch calls to query our internal Api.

# Nurses Station Screens
These are generated using React.js as a templating libary.
